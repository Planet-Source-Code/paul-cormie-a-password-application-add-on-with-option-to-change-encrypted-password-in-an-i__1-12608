### Description

I looked here and couldnt find what i was looking for, so i made it and am making it availible to everyone!

allows simple encryption to an external *.ini file (you choose location) as well, there is another dialog box that allows the user to change the password to whatever. READ THE READ_ME_.txt before running the password.exe. the password.exe is just to give you a quick view of the program. You have to go into the code and change a few of the settings.

----

all the code is commented for easy customization, and i hope you enjoy it!
